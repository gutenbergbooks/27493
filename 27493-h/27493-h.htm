<h3>AN APPEAL FOR INSPIRATION.</h3>

<p class="center">
[Mr. <span class="sc">Lewis Morris</span> has been
requested to write an ode on the
approaching Royal Marriage.]
</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p><span class="sc">Awake</span> my Muse, inspire your <span class="sc">Lewis Morris</span></p>
<p>To pen an ode! to be another Horris!</p>
<p>"<span class="sc">Horace</span>" I should have written, but in place of it</p>
<p>You see the word&mdash;well, I'm within an <i>ace</i> of it.</p>
<p>Awake my muse! strike up! your bard inspire</p>
<p>To write this&mdash;"by particular desire."</p>
<p>Wet towels! Midnight oil! Here! Everything</p>

Musical Performance, with
Accompaniment</span>.&mdash;Mr. <span class="sc">John
Morley</span> arrived last Friday
at Kingston. He went to
Bray. He was "accompanied"
by the Under Secretary.
Surely the Leader of the Opposition,
now at Belfast, won't
lose such a chance as this item
of news offers.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">The "Water-Carnival</span>."&mdash;Good
idea! But a very
large proportion of those whom
the show attracts would be all
the better for a Soap-and-Water
Carnival. Old Father
Thames might be considerably
improved by the process.</p>

<p><i>Mistress.</i> "<span class="sc">Well, James, how did you like the Show? I hope you
got a good view."</span></p>

<p><i>Jim.</i> "<span class="sc">Yes thankye, M'm; I saw it first-rate. There was room
fur Four or Five more where I was</span>."</p>

<p><i>Mistress (surprised).</i> "<span class="sc">Indeed!&mdash;where was that</span>?"</p>

<h4>ODDS BOBBILI!</h4>

P.&amp; O. at Marseilles, where he
was received by Col. Humphrey
on behalf of the Queen.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="sc">Is the <i>Times</i> also among
the Punsters</span>?&mdash;In its masterly,
or rather school-masterly,
article last Saturday, on "The
Divisions on the Home-Rule
Bill," written with the special
intention of whipping up the
Unionist absentees, the <i>Times</i>
said, "There is an opinion that,
with a measure so far-reaching
in its character as the
Home-Rule Bill, pairing should
be resorted to as sparingly as
possible." The eye gifted with
a three-thousand-joke-search-light
power sees the pun at
once, and reproduces it italicised,
to be read aloud, thus&mdash;"<i>Pairing</i>
should be resorted
to <i>as pairingly</i> as possible."
What shall he have who makes
a pun in the <i>Times</i>? Our congratulations.
Henceforth, to
the jest-detectors this new
development may prove most
interesting.</p>

<p>With you I'd willingly be wed,</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Arms (and Legs) of the Isle of
Man</span>.&mdash;At a discussion on Sunday-trading,
one day last month, there was an attempt
made to raise a question as to breach of
privilege. The Speaker, however, stopped
this at the outset, advising them that they
"hadn't a leg to stand upon." Very little
advantage in having three legs on such an
occasion. The odd part of these Manx-men's
legs is that they are their arms. It
was originally selected as pictorially exhibiting
the innocent character of the Manx
Islanders. For their greatest enemy must
own that "the strange device" of the three
legs is utterly 'armless.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Change Its Name</span>!&mdash;An estate in the Island
of Fowlness, Essex, of 382 acres, was put up
to auction last week, and, according to the
<i>Daily News</i> there was only one bid at a little
short of eight pounds per acre. "The
property was withdrawn." This step was
judicious and correct. It was an act of fairness
to Fowlness. But then, does it sound
nice for anyone to say, "I'm living in the
midst of Fowlness"? It may be a Paradise,
but it doesn't sound like it.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Vestries, Please Copy</span>!&mdash;Sir <span class="sc">Richard
Temple</span> has announced a reduction of the
School-Board Rate by a farthing in the pound.
May he never become a ruined Temple owing
to such economies! The Rate-payers will be
grateful for even a fraction of a penny, so long
as it is not an improper fraction. This sort
of saving is far better than squabbling over
Theology. Says <i>Mr. Punch</i> to Schoolboardmen,
"Rate the public lightly, and don't

<p><i>Under the Great Seal</i> is a new work

from answers given to his "fishing interrogatories,"
he gathers that international

dedicating it to <span class="sc">Seale-Hayne</span>, M.P., and,

<h3>AT THE NEW GALLERY.</h3>

<h4><span class="sc">In the Central Hall.</span></h4>

<p><i>A Potential Purchaser (meeting a friend).</i> Ha&mdash;just come in to
take a look round, eh? So did I. Fact is&mdash;(<i>with a mixture of
importance and apology</i>) I rather thought of <i>buying</i> a picture here,
if I see anything that takes my <i>fancy</i>&mdash;y' know.</p>

<p><i>His Friend (impressed).</i> Not many who can afford to throw money
away on pictures, these hard times!</p>

<p><i>The P. P. (anxious to disclaim any idea of recklessness).</i> Just the
time to pick 'em up cheap, if you know what you're about. And
you see, we've had the drawing-room done up, and the wife wants
something to fill up the space over her writing-table, between the
fireplace and one of the windows. She was to have met me here, but
she couldn't turn up, so I shall have to do it all myself&mdash;unless
you'll come and help me through with it?</p>

<p><i>His Friend.</i> Oh, if I can be of any use&mdash;What sort of thing do
you want?</p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> Well, that's the difficulty. She says it must match
the new paper. I've brought a bit in my pocket with me.
His Friend. Then you can't
go <i>very</i> far wrong!</p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> I don't know. It's
a sort of paper that&mdash;here, I'd
better show it you. (<i>He produces
a sample of fiery and
untamed colour.</i>) That'll give
you an <i>idea</i> of it.</p>

<p><i>His Friend (inspecting it
dubiously).</i> Um&mdash;yes. I see
you'll have to be <i>careful</i>.</p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> Careful, my dear
fellow! I assure you I've been
all through the Academy, and
there wasn't a thing there that
could stand it for a single
moment&mdash;not even the R.A.'s!</p>

<p><i>Her Mother (cautiously).</i> I

He's the great <i>man</i> for it, you

<p><i>First Painter (who had nothing

H'm, yes. Can't say I care
about the way he's placed his

more to the left, myself.</p>

<p><i>Second Painter (who sent in,

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> Can you make this picture out, Mamma? "<i>The

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> Sheep, I should suppose, my dear&mdash;but it would
have been more satisfactory certainly if the animal had been shown
<i>in</i> the picture.</p>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> Yes, ever so much. Oh, here's a portrait of
Mr. <span class="sc">Gladstone</span> reading the Lessons in Hawarden Church. I <i>do</i>
like that&mdash;don't you?</p>

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> I'm not sure that I do, my dear. I wonder they
permitted the Artist to paint any portrait&mdash;even Mr.
<span class="sc">Gladstone's</span>&mdash;during
service!</p>

<p><i>The P. P. (before another canvas).</i> Now that's about the size
I want; but I'm not sure that my wife would quite care about the
<i>subject</i>.</p>

<p><i>His Friend.</i> I'm rather fond of these allegorical affairs myself&mdash;for
a drawing-room, you know.</p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> Well, I'll just try the paper against it. (<i>He applies
the test, and shakes his head.</i>) "There, you <i>see</i>&mdash;knocks it all to

<p><i>His Friend.</i> I was afraid it would, y' know. How will <i>this</i> do
you&mdash;<i>"A Naiad"?</i></p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> I shouldn't object to it myself, but there's the Wife
to be considered&mdash;and then, a <i>Naiad</i>&mdash;eh?</p>

<p><i>His friend.</i> She's half <i>in</i> the water.</p>

<p><i>The P. P.</i> Yes, but then&mdash;those lily-leaves in her hair, you
know, and&mdash;and coming up all dripping like that&mdash;no, it's hardly
worth while bringing out the paper again!</p>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> Isn't this queer&mdash;"<i>Neptune's Horses</i>"?&mdash;They
<i>can't</i> be intended to represent <i>waves</i>, surely!</p>

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> It's impossible to tell what the Painter intended,
my dear, but I never saw waves so like horses as that.</p>


<h4><span class="sc">In the North Room.</span></h4>

<p><i>The I. Y. P. "Cain's First Crime."</i> Why, he's only feeding a
stork! I don't see any crime in that.</p>

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> He's giving it a live lizard, my dear.</p>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> But storks <i>like</i> live lizards, don't they? And
<span class="sc">Adam</span>
and <span class="sc">Eve</span> are looking on, and
don't seem to mind.</p>

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> I expect that's
the moral of it. If they'd taken
it away from him, and punished
him at the time, he wouldn't
have turned out so badly as he
did&mdash;but it's too late to think
of that <i>now</i>!</p>

Oh, <span class="sc">Caroline</span>, <i>you</i>'ve got the

to be a country-house, and
they're having dinner in the

have come late, and without
dressing, and there's the hostess
telling them it's of no consequence.
What's the title&mdash;"<i>The
Uninvited Guests</i>," or
"<i>Putting them at their Ease</i>,"
or what?</p>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> It only says,
<i>"The Rose-Garden at Ashridge</i>

Earls of <span class="sc">Pembroke</span> and
<span class="sc">Brownlow</span>, the Countesses
of &mdash;&mdash;").</p>


<p class="right">[<i>She reads out the list to the end.</i></p>


<p><i>Her Mother.</i> What a <i>nice</i>

have thought such smart folks
wouldn't have come to dinner
in riding-boots, and shawls, and
things&mdash;but of course they can
afford to be less particular.

<h4><span class="sc">In the South Room.</span></h4>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> Why, here are "<i>Neptune's Horses" again!</i> Don't
you remember we saw a picture of them before? But I like this
better, because here you get Neptune and his chariot.</p>

<p><i>Her Mother.</i> He's made his horses a little too like fish, for my
taste.</p>

<p><i>The I. Y. P.</i> I suppose they <i>were</i> a sort of fish&mdash;and after all,
one
isn't expected to believe in all that nowadays, is one? So it doesn't

<p><i>Second H. M.</i> Oh, I don't know&mdash;one of the Hussar regiments

<p><i>The P. P. (before a small
canvas).</i> Yes, this is the right
thing at last. The paper
doesn't seem to put it out in
the least, and the sort of subject,
you know, that <i>no</i> one

fallen in love with it. I don't

<p>Is it fair, I ask you, Sirr, is
it fair to quote the Universal
Bard against us Ulster, <i>et ne
plus</i> Ulster, Loyalists? Yet
this is the line which a man
who used to call himself "a
friend of mine" sends me, and
he puts a drawing with it,
which I can't, and won't reproduce,
representing a moon
up in the sky, labelled "Home
Rule," and a pack of wolves
(a pack of idiots, for all
they're like wolves, for that
matter), on which he writes
"Ulster," with their mouths
open, looking up at it. And
this, he says, is an illustration
of a line in <span class="sc">Shakspeare</span>,</p>

<blockquote><p>
"The howling of Irish wolves
against the moon,"
</p></blockquote>

<h3>A CIVIL NOTE FOR THE MILITARY.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">My Dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I observe that in a preliminary notice
that has been sent round to the Press by the Executive Council (I
suppose that that is the proper title of the Governing Body of the
forthcoming Royal Military Tournament), it is said that there is
likely to be some novelty in the mimic warfare known as the Combined
Display of all Arms. The circular informs those whom it may
concern, that "it is intended that, so far as space will allow, the
scene shall be that of one of the more recent conflicts in which
British troops were actually engaged, and special information from
those present on such occasions has been invited, so that the result
is likely to be of more than ordinary interest."</p>

<p>Quite so. I call your particular attention to the last few words in
the above sentence, in which reference is made to "the special
information from those present on such occasions." I thought the idea
so good, that I immediately prepared a scheme for the adoption of
the Royal Military Tournament, founded upon my acquaintance
with the manners and customs of the English army when at
Islington and elsewhere. I give it for what it is worth&mdash;not much,
but (to quote the once popular song) "better than nothing at all."</p>


<h4><span class="sc">Rough Idea.</span></h4>

<p>A dozen Infantry privates saunter leisurely into their places, half-way
across the arena, and await events.</p>

<p>Enter Bridging Battalion, Royal Engineers. They bridge over an
old cloth river. The dozen Infantry men wait until the erection is
completed, and then fire a volley. The Sappers return the compliment.
No one hurt, and the dozen retire to the tower-like gateway
in the background. The Artillery at this point rush in and trot over
the newly-erected bridge. They then fire in the direction of the
dozen heroes, but without any apparent result.</p>

<p>Grand charge of Colonial Cavalry, with and without additional
men. They act as Mounted Infantry. They are fired upon&mdash;in a
half-hearted sort of way&mdash;by the dozen of Infantry seeking shelter
in the gateway. The fire seems to agree with them.</p>

<p>Enter an Ambulance Corps to pick up one of the colonists who has
obligingly been wounded by the blank cartridges of the dozen
Infantry.</p>

<p>Sudden appearance of the strength of the entire company. The
gateway is stormed, and the dozen Infantry men are overpowered.
Music on the band&mdash;"<i>Rule Britannia!</i>" and the <i>National Anthem</i>.
Great cheering while some one waves the Union Jack. End of the
performances.</p>

<p>There, my dear <i>Mr. Punch</i>, that is what I have sent to the
"powers that are" at Islington. Whether it has been accepted or
rejected I do not know. You will be able to see for yourself when
the proper time arrives.</p>

<p>But then, I can assure you, my sketch is <i>exactly like the real
thing</i>. It is not unsuggestive of the Battle of Waterloo, the siege of
Sebastopol, or the taking of Pekin. This is my "special information,
as one present on such occasions," and it is heartily at the service of
the Executive. To be worthy of my title, I would beg you to send
me, say, a fiver, or even a sov, or (if that is too much) a dollar.</p>

<p>I do not ask for the money as a gift, but as a loan. I prefer the
latter to the former, although a long experience has taught me that
gift and loan have much the same meaning.</p>

<p><span class="sc">O Sino San! O Sino San!</span> Who waketh me at morn!</p>
<p>Why is it that I feel of thee unutterable scorn?</p>

<p>When I behold thy greasy poll and little piggy eyes,</p>
<p>I fear that they have told of thee unwarrantable lies!</p>
<p>They told me when I wandered forth to seek thee in Japan,</p>

  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>They told me of thy cherry cheeks, thy hair of night-dark sable,</p>
<p>And how you squatted on the floor&mdash;the Japanese for table;</p>

<p>In thee, the girl idealised, you little fraud, we saw.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>But now in wind-swept bleak Japan as our sore throats we muffle,</p>

<h3>OPERATIC NOTES.</h3>

<p><i>Monday, May 15.</i>&mdash;First Night of Italian-Opera Season no longer
exclusively Italian. A great deal, though not everything, in a good
start, so Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> leads off with Warbling <span class="sc">Wagner's</span>
<i>Lohengrin</i>, Signor <span class="sc">Vignas</span> for first time being White Knight.
Crowded House at once takes to <span class="sc">Vignas</span>; applauds, and recalls him
to bow before the curtain. So, as the now popular song might
have it,</p>

<p class="center">
"Tenor came and made us a bow-wow!"
</p>

<p>Madame <span class="sc">Melba</span> good as ever as <i>Elsa</i>, and Mlle.
<span class="sc">Meisslinger</span> most
dramatic as Somebody Elser, <i>i.e., Ortruda</i>, the Intruder. Mons.
<span class="sc">Dufriche's</span> style is exactly suited to the light and airy part of
<i>Federico
di Telramondo</i>, while <span class="sc">Castelmary</span> is quite the gay <i>Enrico</i>.
Treat
to see <span class="sc">Vaschetti</span> as smiling Herald, with a lot to say for somebody
else,
and pleasant to note that the last person in the <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i>
included
in the cast of the Opera is "Conductor, Signor <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>,"
who beats time, winning easily. <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> conducts <i>National
Anthem</i>, and all conduct themselves loyally on the occasion.
Delightful, in <i>Lohengrin</i>, Act II., to observe how four players of
trumps, each with one trump in his hand,&mdash;quite a pleasant whist
party&mdash;(have they the other trumps up their sleeves?)&mdash;arouse the
guests in the early morning, and marvellous is the rapidity with
which all the gentlemen sleeping in the Castle are up and dressed
in full armour, freshly burnished,&mdash;"gents suit complete,"&mdash;within
the space of a couple of minutes!</p>

<div class="figright" style="width:180px;"><a href="images/249b.png"><img src="images/249b-150.png" width="150" height="316" alt="Signor Vignas as Turiddu" /></a>
<p>Signor Vignas as Turiddu,&mdash;so
called because he tells
Lola, "I should like <i>Turid-you</i>
of your husband."
&nbsp;But he didn't.</p>
</div>

<p>General excellence of performance greatly assisted by Duke of <span class="sc">Teck</span>
enthusiastically beating time with his dexter
band. Such auxiliary conducting must be
of unspeakable service to Signor <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;<i>Orfeo</i>, with <span class="sc">Giulia
Ravogli</span> charming as ever in her representation
of "<i>Orpheus</i> with his <i>loot</i>,"&mdash;his
"loot" being <i>Eurydice</i>, who had become
the private property of that infernal monarch
Pluto. Welcome to Mlle. <span class="sc">Bauermeister</span>
as the Meister of Cupid's Bower,
Cupid himself. <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i> to
follow, with Madame <span class="sc">Calv&eacute;'s</span> grand impersonation
of the simple and sad <i>Santuzza</i>.
Notably good is <span class="sc">Vignas</span> as the Rustic Swell,
with the comic-chorus name of <i>Turiddu</i>.
Beautiful <i>intermezzo</i> heartily encored. The
thanks of Signors <span class="sc">Bevignani</span> and <span class="sc">Mancinelli</span>
again due to the dexterous assistance
rendered to them by the Duke of <span class="sc">Teck</span>, who
is evidently well up in the Teck-nique of
the musical craft. Crowded House. <i>Forecast
of season</i>, full of promise and performance.</p>


<p><i>Thursday.&mdash;Carmen.</i> Always "good
<span class="sc">Bizet</span>-ness." But on this occasion Madame
<span class="sc">Calv&eacute;</span> being indisposed, Mlle. <span class="sc">Sigrid
Arnoldson</span> appears as heroine. A most captivating
<i>Carmen</i>, but so deftly does she
dissemble her wickedness that the audience
do not realise how heartless is this artful
little cigarette-maker. Mons. <span class="sc">Alvarez</span> a fine
<i>Don Jos&eacute;</i>. The <i>premi&egrave;res danseuses</i> lively and picturesque in Act
II.,
with dresses long and dance short; but in Last Act, when reverse
of this is the case, a pretty general feeling that skirts might have
been longer, and dance shorter. Chorus and Orchestra all that could
be desired; absence of the musical Duke much regretted.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width:200px;"><a href="images/249c.png"><img src="images/249c-200.png" width="200" height="118" alt="Santuzza, Madame Calvé. Grand tragédienne:" /></a>
<p>Santuzza, Madame Calv&eacute;. Grand trag&eacute;dienne:
gloomy as an Operatic Calv&eacute;-nist.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;First, <span class="sc">Gounod's</span> charming burletta of <i>Philemon et
Baucis</i>.
Mlle. <span class="sc">Sigrid Arnoldson</span>
charming and childlike as
<i>Baucis</i>&mdash;evidently the
classic original of Bo-peep&mdash;and
Mons. <span class="sc">Plan&ccedil;on</span>
excellent as <i>Jupiter
Amans</i>. At first afraid
lest crowded house had
expended all its enthusiasm
before quarter past
ten, when <i>the</i> event of
the evening was to come
off. "Not a bit of it,"
says Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span>,
who knows his operatic public; "they've just warmed up for
<span class="sc">Leoncavallo's</span> <i>Pagliacci</i>. <span class="sc">Leoncavallo</span>," he continues,
"is the
composer for my money; and my advice is, <span class="sc">Lay-on-cavallo's</span>
<i>Pagliacci</i>." So saying, the Musical Manager lightly touches his
nasal organ with the index finger of his right hand, and, at the
same time "winking the other eye," he marches in a procession of
one down the lobby and disappears.</p>

<p>Great as is the success to-night of new Opera, I feel sure that
<i>Cavalleria</i>, with its simple story, and its marvellous <i>intermezzo</i>,
is
still at the head of the poll. Yet is <i>Pagliacci</i> melodious and dramatic.
Madame <span class="sc">Melba</span> at her best in <i>Nedda</i>, and the dramatic power,
specially
of Signor <span class="sc">de Lucia</span> as <i>Canio</i> and of Mons. <span class="sc">Ancona</span> as
<i>Tonio</i>, would
have carried the piece, as a piece, even without the musical setting.
To-night <i>De Lucia</i> shows himself a great actor. There were <i>encores</i>
in plenty. <i>Ancona Tonio</i> interrupts the overture in order to sing a
prologue. This he does admirably, both vocally and histrionically. But
<i>cui bono</i>? It is as pointless as is nowadays the prologue of
<span class="sc">Christopher
Sly</span> to the <i>Taming of the Shrew</i>. It seems as if <span class="sc">Leoncavallo</span>
said to himself, "<i>Mascagni</i> gave 'em a novelty in his <i>intermezzo</i>;
I'll give 'em something new in the shape of a prologue." <i>Pagliacci</i>
and <i>Cavalleria</i> will assist each other, and Sir <span class="sc">Druriolanus</span> is
fortunate
in being able to run two winners. The new Opera is
admirably rendered in every respect, and when Mr. <span class="sc">Richard Green</span>,
as the gallant young farmer, is matured&mdash;that is, has less of the
<span class="sc">Green</span> about him and more of the ripeness of artistic perfection&mdash;there
will not be a single fault to find with the representation.
To-night second Opera didn't end till just on twelve. Too late; but
the hospitable <span class="sc">Rule's</span> in Maiden Lane is open to exceptions for half
an hour or so, and, "after the Opera is over," a little supper <i>chez</i>
<span class="sc">Bayliss</span> is a B(ay)lissful idea.</p>

<p><i>Saturday.&mdash;Faust</i> to finish. <span class="sc">Melba</span> as <i>Marguerite</i>. First
week
augurs well for the season.</p>

<h3>THE LITIGANTS VADE MECUM.</h3>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is your opinion about Chancery?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That, thanks to work being given to Solicitors in preference to
Barristers, litigation is more expensive in that branch of the science
than in any other.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> How comes it that this should be so?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> A Barrister is forced to do his best for his client, but a Solicitor
is not. As a rule the Solicitor deputes to his Chief Clerk if he has one,
or somebody in the office if he has not, the duties of conducting a
suit through Chambers.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> What is the practical result of this arrangement?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That a suit when it once gets into Chambers takes a precious
long time in coming out.</p>

<p><i>Q.</i> But making allowance for these little drawbacks, what is your
opinion of the Law in England?</p>

<p><i>A.</i> That emphatically it consists of the best forensic regulations in
the universe.</p>

<hr />

<p><span class="sc">A New Clause in the Home-Rule Bill</span>.&mdash;Instead of a Parliament
in Dublin, let the Governing Body be called "A Diet," as it
is in Bohemia. There would be a First House, to be called the
"High Diet," and a Second House, to be called "Short Commons, or
Low Diet." There would be no "Parliamentary Rules," but everything
would be ordered according to a "Dietary." Perhaps
Dr. <span class="sc">Robson Roose</span> might be induced to take a leading part in
suggesting some of these arrangements. The "Orders of the Day"
would be "Prescriptions," the Bills "Dinner-Bills," or "<i>Menus</i>."
A Chairman, not a Speaker, would preside, and the subordinates&mdash;such
as Clerks, Sergeant-at-Arms, and Assistants&mdash;would be
Stewards, Head Waiters, and other Waiters. Prayers would be
said by "The Ordinary."</p>

<h3>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h3>

<h4>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h4>

<p><i>Home of Commons, Monday, May 15.</i>&mdash;Mr. G. reminded of
advance of time by appearance on Parliamentary scene of new generations.
All remember when <span class="sc">Joey C</span>. arrived from Birmingham,
and have watched his meteoric flight from level of Provincial
Mayor to loftiest height of Parliamentary position. Only the other
week Mr. G. was paying well-deserved compliment to a younger
<span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> making his maiden speech; to-day he has a kindly,
fatherly word of friendly recognition of maiden speech of youngest
<span class="sc">Cavendish</span>. No mere compliment this, extorted by old associations
and personal predilections. Young <span class="sc">Victor</span> went about his work in
style reminiscent of middle-aged <span class="sc">Hartington</span>. Abstained from
oratorical effort. Neither exordium nor peroration. Got some
business in hand, and plodded on till it was finished. Modest mien,
simple, unaffected manner, instantly won friendly attention of
crowded House.</p>

<p>"<i>Ay de mi!</i> <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said Mr. G. "These things make me
think I'm not so young as I was."</p>

<p>"Younger Sir," I said. "Pup and dog, I've known you twenty
years; heard most of your speeches in that time; honestly declare
that for lightness of touch, swiftness of attack, wariness of defence,
not to speak of eloquence, I've never heard you excel some of your
speeches this Session."</p>

<p>"Well, well, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said Mr. G., blushing in fashion never
learned by youth of to-day, "that's due to your too friendly way
of looking at things. What I was about to say is, that ever since
I entered public life I have always known a <span class="sc">Cavendish</span> to the fore.
Ministries may rise and fall; the <span class="sc">Cavendishes</span> remain. Curious
thing is they have not&mdash;at least in recent times&mdash;personally a
passion for politics, as <span class="sc">Pitt</span> had, or such as, in some degree,
influences
me. They would, if they had their own way, be out of it.</p>

</div>

<p>
But the <span class="sc">Cavendishes</span> have had their place in English public life
throughout the Century, and, it being their duty to fill it, they fill it.
Young <span class="sc">Victor's</span> speech on Friday night carried me back over space
of thirty-four years. I remember another <span class="sc">Cavendish</span> coming out.
He moved resolution which
defeated <span class="sc">Derby's</span> Government
in 1859. I remember the difficulty
we had in bringing him
up to the scratch. It was
<span class="sc">Bright</span> who finally succeeded.
<span class="sc">Bright</span> always had great
opinion of <span class="sc">Hartington's</span>
ability, a view, as we have
seen, amply justified. A great
deal has happened since 1859,
and now here's another
<span class="sc">Cavendish</span> moving another
Amendment, and, oddly enough"&mdash;here
Mr. G.'s face wrinkled into smile of
delighted humour&mdash;"it's <span class="sc">ME</span> who would
be turned out of office if the Amendment
were carried."</p>

<p>Being thus in melting mood, Mr. <span class="sc">G.</span>
suddenly turned upon inoffensive <span class="sc">Jesse
Collings</span>, who had been saying a few
words, and almost literally rent him into,
fragments. Scarcely anything left of
him but benevolent though feeble smile.</p>

<p><i>Business Done.</i>&mdash;Very little in Committee
on Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday Night.</i>&mdash;<span class="sc">Ambrose</span>, Q.C.,
roused at last. House known him for
eight years; only to-night learned that
it has been cherishing upon its bosom a
sleeping volcano. Following fortunes
of Conservative leaders, <span class="sc">Ambrose</span> has
crossed and re-crossed floor, always
taking up seat about centre of Bench immediately behind <span class="sc">Prince
Arthur</span>; has occasionally risen thence and offered a few observations.
Characteristic of him that he was born in a Cathedral town; is
a Bencher of the Middle Temple.</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p class="i12">Persuasion tips his tongue whene'er he'll talk,</p>
<p class="i12">And he has Chambers near the King's Bench Walk.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>These things we knew; but not till
to-night came discovery how persuasive
<span class="sc">Ambrose</span> can be.</p>

<p>It was the Tenth Clause of the Home-Rule
Bill that roused the (attorney's)
devil in him. Fact that Clause II. was
under discussion, and consequently out
of order to debate Clause X., an incident
of no consequence, except that it indirectly
supplied incentive to his passionate
eloquence, and led to disclosure of the
true <span class="sc">Ambrose</span>. When he approached
Clause X., cries of "Order! Order!"
interrupted. The Chairman recalled him
to consideration of Clause II. He came
back, said a few words on amendment,
then was off again at Clause X., pursued
by howls. Had got a start, and kept it
through some moments of thunderous
excitement. Waved his arms, thumped
his papers; shouted at top of voice; House still howling; Chairman on
feet ineffectually protesting. "Glad to see the <span class="sc">Solicitor-Gentleman</span>
in his place," he observed, in one of the temporary pauses,
(<span class="sc">Rigby</span> usually alluded to as the <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>, but
<span class="sc">Ambrose</span>, once started in new character, was lavish in originality.)
"Need I go further?" he asked, a few moments later. House, with
one accord, shouted "No!" "Now Sir," he added, waving his
notes in face of Chairman, "I've done with the Tenth Clause."
But he hadn't; its mastery over him was irresistible, even uncanny.
"I should like to know what the <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>" (got it right
this time) "if he were at liberty to speak" (this with a withering
glance at Mr. <span class="sc">G.</span>), "would say about the Tenth Clause?"</p>

<p>A roar angrier than ever burst forth; shouts of "Name! Name!"
persistently heard above uproar; Chairman on his feet, with hands
outstretched; crisis evidently arrived; <span class="sc">Ambrose</span> will be named to a
dead certainty; suspended, and, perhaps, in addition to his bench at
the Middle Temple, will have one provided for him in Clock Tower.
Would like to have said few more words on Tenth Clause, but
numbers against him overwhelming. So wildly waved his notes
in sort of forlorn despairing farewell, and resumed his seat.
Incident created profound sensation.</p>

<p>"It's all very well <span class="sc">Chamberlain</span> insisting on keeping this thing
going," said <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>, anxiously; "but I have my responsibilities.
If Debate at this comparatively early stage thus affects a
man like <span class="sc">Ambrose</span>, where shall we all be in another week?"</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Still on Clause II.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;Pretty to see <span class="sc">Gorst</span> just now balancing
<span class="sc">Macartney's</span>
hat by brim on tip of his nose. Looks easy enough when done
by an expert; those inclined to scoff at the accomplishment
should try it themselves. Opportunity came suddenly, and unexpectedly.
No ground for supposing <span class="sc">Gorst</span> had been practising
the trick in the Cloak-room before entering House. No collusion;
all fair and above-board&mdash;or, rather, above nose. Came about as
incident in Committee on Home-Rule Bill. <span class="sc">Jokim</span>, taking part in
game of Chairman-baiting, challenged <span class="sc">Mellor's</span> ruling on putting
Motion to Report Progress. House being cleared for a Division,
rules of debate require Member to address Chair seated, and wearing
his hat. What would happen to British Constitution if, in such
circumstances, Member rose and addressed <span class="sc">Speaker</span> or Chairman
in ordinary fashion, Heaven only knows. No mere man bold enough
to try it. Even Mr. <span class="sc">G.</span>, who has Disestablished a Church, and now
tampers with Unity of the Empire, shrinks before this temptation.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Jokim</span>, making his complaint, got along all right. Performed
task in due form; <span class="sc">Mellor</span> justified his action; <span class="sc">Gorst</span> proposed
to
follow. Hadn't got his hat with him; but that of no consequence,
since <span class="sc">Jokim</span> was at hand. "Lend me one of your hats," he whispered
hurriedly to his Right Hon. Friend.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said <span class="sc">Jokim</span>. "I've only one."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said <span class="sc">Gorst</span>, raising his eyebrows with polite incredulity.
<span class="sc">Macartney</span>, sitting behind, proffered his. <span class="sc">Gorst</span> planted it on
his
head; found it three sizes too small; still, if he held on to it, he
might manage. "Mr. <span class="sc">Mellor</span>," he commenced, but got no further
with projected speech. Attention of House drawn to him his
dilemma discovered: shout of laughter burst forth as hat gradually
tilted forward, and <span class="sc">Gorst</span>, deftly catching it by brim on tip of his
nose, balanced it for fifteen seconds by Westminster Clock. Chairman
seized opportunity of abstracted attention to put question, and
when <span class="sc">Gorst</span>, recapturing <span class="sc">Macartney's</span> hat, had fixed it again on
summit of his head, division was called; too late for him to speak.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Second Clause Home Rule Bill added.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Treasury Chest Bill on for Third Reading. Has since
introduction wrought singular effect upon <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>. Nobody knows
what Bill is about, least of all <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>; but he has opposed it at
every stage. Yesterday divided Committee on First Clause; returns
to attack to-day. "Better let us get away for our hardly-earned
holiday," I said.</p>

<p>"That's very well for you, <span class="sc">Toby</span>," said <span class="sc">Hanbury</span>, beating his
chest in default of getting at the Treasury's; "but there's a dark
mystery under this business which I mean to fathom. You remember
the case of another chest and its weird associations?</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">

quite clear on that point. Indeed I'm somewhat muddled in the

I have done my best to plumb its slimy depths."</p>
